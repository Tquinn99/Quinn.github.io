 I created my web portfolio trying to use a simple clean design with  minimal animations. I wanted the focus to be on my best work and thought a blank canvas style would help to showcase that. I figured i'd make it seem more business orineted in case someone was looking for someone to work on there projects.

 Some struggles I faced when designing was trying to make it feel less bland, which is why I added some subtle animations and some shadows that are simple yet effective. 

 I had some trouble fixing my contact button on my portfolio.

 I learned that planning in advance is huge when it comes to web design. a smooth vision with coding in mind when designing can make coding life a breeze.

 Images that were not mine!
